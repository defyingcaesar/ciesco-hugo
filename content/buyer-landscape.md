## Most active buyers

In 2020, the list of Top 10 most active acquirers in terms of the number of their acquisitions in the focus sector, is dominated by Private Equity firms, and features a mix of consultancies, tech companies, holding networks and mid-market groups. With a combined 66 deals in total, the Top 10 Most Active Buyers in 2020 stand at just 6.3% of total transactions in the sector. Compared to the 84 acquisitions completed by the 2019 Top 10 buyers, this year’s 66 deal count shows a 21% decline, amid the turbulent market conditions in 2020.

This decline also represents a flattening buyer activity. The number of deals per buyer in this list ranges from 5 to 12, and just three years ago this spread was between 4 and 24.

Accenture remains the most active buyer in the sector, despite a 25% year-on-year reduction in the number of transactions from 2019. The consultancy giant is renowned for its strong service offering, innovative business model and long-term relationship building. The acquisitions are a part of its strategy to acquire specific capabilities and skills to enhance innovation, transformation, cloud computing, data and AI expertise for their clients.

Only one of the Big Six global holding companies – Dentsu, features this year in the Top 10 most active buyers category, with its six completed deals – albeit this represents a 54% decline on its 2019 activity . All holding  networks demonstrated a diminished appetite for acquisitions in 2020, apart from WPP. And IPG The network completed four transactions, after only one acquisition in 2019, and IPG - its first acquisition since 2018.

Following the trend of the past few years, Private Equity firms feature even more prominently in the top most active buyers. Waterland, the Netherlands-based global private equity firm, emerged as the most active Private Equity buyer in the sector in 2020, with eight deals, up from only one deal in 2019. Seven of these acquisitions have formed part of building the Belgium-based Intracto digital agency group, where Waterland invested in 2018.  Other active PE buyers were a US-based Providence Equity with six deals, and Ardian and KKR with five acquisitions each. Private Equity houses proved their resilience once again, accounting for 37% of the deals in the sector.

Twitter and Cognizant are two of the most active technology buyers in 2020, with seven acquisitions each. Twitter’s focus on the digital media and MarTech, and Cognizant’s interest in data, analytics and strategy are reflective of tech giants’ commitment to increase their business scope with future proof business segments and capabilities.

Among the most active mid-market groups, 2020 saw the re-emergence of the Japanese marketing and PR giant Hakuhodo, acquiring five companies in 2020, most of these acquisitions were driven by Hakuhodo’s kyu, a collective of strategically curated creative organizations.

S4 Capital, the acquisition vehicle of Sir Martin Sorrell, made a few headlines in 2020, with its continued expansion plans, and five acquisitions announced. Currently, the group has over 1,800 employees in 23 countries, with plans to double in scale by 2021. In July 2020, Sorrell raised $126m to fund further M&A and indicated plans to accelerate its deal-making activity as there is now less uncertainty over Brexit.

# Global holding networks

After sluggish activity in 2019 it was expected that the global holding networks would pick up the pace in 2020 but again their emphasis was on putting their houses in order in terms of restructuring, consolidation, and senior management changes across many of their network agencies – with continued announcements of a series of considered internal company mergers. With priorities elsewhere, not least repercussions from the COVID-19 pandemic, it was then unsurprising that only a total of 15 acquisitions were completed in the year, a marked decrease of 42% versus 2019.

There has been a dramatic decrease from the halcyon days of 2016 when 95 deals were completed by the Big Six holding networks representing 8% of all activity that year. Their acquisition strategy and direction has changed over the past four years with digital, data and technology overall playing a major part of their focus and needs as they continue to be able to future proof their businesses, capabilities, and offerings – and at scale across multiple geographies. The competitive set, notably from the Consultancies, has made that more challenging as they are no longer the first or natural choice for the would-be seller in the market within the overall Buyer landscape.

Dentsu was once again the most acquisitive, a mantle they have held for the past three years, with 6 transactions conducted via three of their operating companies – Merkle, Voyange Group and

Cmer TV – across the US and Japan markets. This was against a back-drop of the announcement that that the current Dentsu Inc will shift to a "pure holding company structure" in January and its trade name will be changed to Dentsu Group Inc.  A new in-house company, Dentsu Japan Network, will also be established to run the group's overall operations in Japan. In parallel, Dentsu Aegis Network will run international operations. In combination, Dentsu also announced plans to reduce agency brands from 160 to just 6 with Mcgarrybowen the first to see impact from this restructuring.


WPP was back on the radar with four acquisitions across NZ, the USA and UK. WPP continued to review their multiple global agency network operations and following their previous mergers in forming new entities in VMLY&R and Wunderman Thompson, Finsbury Glover Hering, they surprised the industry further in November by merging AKQI with Grey, which was founded in 1917, to create what they have positioned as an “industry powerhouse” that fuses Grey’s “creative storytelling” with AKQA’s “world-class innovation". The new entity is to be called AKQA Group. Additionally, Mark Read reinforced his belief in the vibrant future of ecommerce business, further enhanced by aggressive online sales throughout the pandemic, by announcing the merger of Geometry into VMLY&R, to create VMLY&R Commerce.

Havas made two acquisitions, respectively in the UK and Australia, with Publicis, IPG and Omnicom each recording a single acquisition.
