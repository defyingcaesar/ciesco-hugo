## Most active buyers

In 2020, the list of Top 10 most active acquirers in terms of the number of their acquisitions in the focus sector, is dominated by Private Equity firms, and features a mix of consultancies, tech companies, holding networks and mid-market groups. With a combined 66 deals in total, the Top 10 Most Active Buyers in 2020 stand at just 6.3% of total transactions in the sector. Compared to the 84 acquisitions completed by the 2019 Top 10 buyers, this year’s 66 deal count shows a 21% decline, amid the turbulent market conditions in 2020.

This decline also represents a flattening buyer activity. The number of deals per buyer in this list ranges from 5 to 12, and just three years ago this spread was between 4 and 24.

Accenture remains the most active buyer in the sector, despite a 25% year-on-year reduction in the number of transactions from 2019. The consultancy giant is renowned for its strong service offering, innovative business model and long-term relationship building. The acquisitions are a part of its strategy to acquire specific capabilities and skills to enhance innovation, transformation, cloud computing, data and AI expertise for their clients.

Only one of the Big Six global holding companies – Dentsu, features this year in the Top 10 most active buyers category, with its six completed deals – albeit this represents a 54% decline on its 2019 activity . All holding  networks demonstrated a diminished appetite for acquisitions in 2020, apart from WPP. And IPG The network completed four transactions, after only one acquisition in 2019, and IPG - its first acquisition since 2018.

Following the trend of the past few years, Private Equity firms feature even more prominently in the top most active buyers. Waterland, the Netherlands-based global private equity firm, emerged as the most active Private Equity buyer in the sector in 2020, with eight deals, up from only one deal in 2019. Seven of these acquisitions have formed part of building the Belgium-based Intracto digital agency group, where Waterland invested in 2018.  Other active PE buyers were a US-based Providence Equity with six deals, and Ardian and KKR with five acquisitions each. Private Equity houses proved their resilience once again, accounting for 37% of the deals in the sector.

Twitter and Cognizant are two of the most active technology buyers in 2020, with seven acquisitions each. Twitter’s focus on the digital media and MarTech, and Cognizant’s interest in data, analytics and strategy are reflective of tech giants’ commitment to increase their business scope with future proof business segments and capabilities.

Among the most active mid-market groups, 2020 saw the re-emergence of the Japanese marketing and PR giant Hakuhodo, acquiring five companies in 2020, most of these acquisitions were driven by Hakuhodo’s kyu, a collective of strategically curated creative organizations.

S4 Capital, the acquisition vehicle of Sir Martin Sorrell, made a few headlines in 2020, with its continued expansion plans, and five acquisitions announced. Currently, the group has over 1,800 employees in 23 countries, with plans to double in scale by 2021. In July 2020, Sorrell raised $126m to fund further M&A and indicated plans to accelerate its deal-making activity as there is now less uncertainty over Brexit.

After sluggish activity in 2019 it was expected that the global holding networks would pick up the pace in 2020 but again their emphasis was on putting their houses in order in terms of restructuring, consolidation, and senior management changes across many of their network agencies – with continued announcements of a series of considered internal company mergers. With priorities elsewhere, not least repercussions from the COVID-19 pandemic, it was then unsurprising that only a total of 15 acquisitions were completed in the year, a marked decrease of 42% versus 2019.

There has been a dramatic decrease from the halcyon days of 2016 when 95 deals were completed by the Big Six holding networks representing 8% of all activity that year. Their acquisition strategy and direction has changed over the past four years with digital, data and technology overall playing a major part of their focus and needs as they continue to be able to future proof their businesses, capabilities, and offerings – and at scale across multiple geographies. The competitive set, notably from the Consultancies, has made that more challenging as they are no longer the first or natural choice for the would-be seller in the market within the overall Buyer landscape.

Dentsu was once again the most acquisitive, a mantle they have held for the past three years, with 6 transactions conducted via three of their operating companies – Merkle, Voyange Group and

Cmer TV – across the US and Japan markets. This was against a back-drop of the announcement that that the current Dentsu Inc will shift to a "pure holding company structure" in January and its trade name will be changed to Dentsu Group Inc.  A new in-house company, Dentsu Japan Network, will also be established to run the group's overall operations in Japan. In parallel, Dentsu Aegis Network will run international operations. In combination, Dentsu also announced plans to reduce agency brands from 160 to just 6 with Mcgarrybowen the first to see impact from this restructuring.


WPP was back on the radar with four acquisitions across NZ, the USA and UK. WPP continued to review their multiple global agency network operations and following their previous mergers in forming new entities in VMLY&R and Wunderman Thompson, Finsbury Glover Hering, they surprised the industry further in November by merging AKQI with Grey, which was founded in 1917, to create what they have positioned as an “industry powerhouse” that fuses Grey’s “creative storytelling” with AKQA’s “world-class innovation". The new entity is to be called AKQA Group. Additionally, Mark Read reinforced his belief in the vibrant future of ecommerce business, further enhanced by aggressive online sales throughout the pandemic, by announcing the merger of Geometry into VMLY&R, to create VMLY&R Commerce.

Havas made two acquisitions, respectively in the UK and Australia, with Publicis, IPG and Omnicom each recording a single acquisition.

###### Deal activity from the global Holding Networks once again reflected and reinforced their desire and need to build and scale further in key disciplines that are creating and driving critical platforms of engagement - most notably in digital, Ecommerce, data & analytics, and experiential – but also in creative and media communication. 

Some highlights in 2020 included Dentsu acquiring Santa Clara based E-Nor, a pioneer in the Google Analytics platform, to further reinforced its market position following the acquisition of marketing analytics consulting arm Cardinal Path, in 2016. The combination sees services and capabilities on marketing analytics with advanced digital data capabilities and partnerships including Adobe, Google - including as a leading reseller of Google Analytics 360 - Salesforce, Tableau, Tealium, and others.

###### In recent years, there has been a consolidation between the global consulting firms – Accenture, Capgemini, Deloitte, PwC and EY – and creative firms.  

Boosting their capabilities with digital, data, technology and industry-specific marketing strategy, through 95 deals completed in total over 4 years, the top consultancies have produced unique, future-proof business models.

###### Data shows that there was a 30% decline in the 2020 M&A activity of the largest consulting firms. The uncertainty caused by the slowdown of global economies, temporarily paused many deal plans globally. 

Despite the 2020 turbulent market, Accenture ranked again as the most active consultancy and buyer in the space. Its strength lies in long-term relationship building and the innovative nature of service offering. Accenture full 2020 M&A activity can be viewed in Figure 9 below.

The team of strategy, technology, creative and campaigning experts, will continue to operate independently, while adding significant value to Capgemini C-level consulting. Capgemini also acquired Advectas, a 200+ people Swedish data science and business intelligence company, which will increase Capgemini’s presence in the Nordics market. Further, its most recent acquisition of Australia-based WhiteSky Labs, one of the largest cloud-based independent consultancy firms, will enhance its public and private sector digital transformation expertise. The announcements came after a very low deal activity in 2019.

EY completed only one acquisition – digital design and customer experience agency Doberman. With a 100-people team in Sweden and New York, Doberman shows strong capabilities in the product & services design, and business transformation space, which will become exceptional assets for EY in the Nordic region.

###### Global technology firms have been active buyers in the space for the last few years. In 2019 their focus was on data and content production-focused companies, whereas in 2020, unsurprisingly, we saw the shift to digital media, video gaming, cloud-based solutions and online marketplaces.

Cognizant, US-based IT services giant, focused on four growth areas in its acquisition strategy in 2020: IoT, Cloud, AI and Analytics and software product engineering. With seven relevant acquisitions, the company was the most acquisitive tech firm in this space in 2020.

{{< container-image path="images/brian-humphreys-quote.png" method="Fit" options="700x536 png q100 Smart" alt="global-holding-networks" >}}

In February, Cognizant acquired EI-Technologies, France-based leading European Salesforce platform specialist and in March - Lev, a digital marketing consultancy that helps businesses modernize their marketing campaigns with data-driven insights

On par with Cognizant, Twitter also acquired seven companies - three via Twitter and four via ShareChat, a Twitter-backed India-based social media platform. Twitter’s M&A efforts showed focus on developing its capabilities in performance advertising (CrossInstall – 70-people mobile-only DSP (Demand-side platform) provider); its creative tools (Chroma Labs); and most recently, its interactive AV-communications capabilities, with the acquisition of Squad, an app that is considered a more “fun” alternative to Zoom. ShareChat has been benefiting from India’s ban of Chinese apps, including the massively popular TikTok, and has focused its M&A efforts on bolstering its content (HPF Films), media (Circle Internet), peer-to-peer communication (Memer) and peer-to-peer ecommerce (Elanic) capabilities. There are rumours in the market that ShareChat is in talks to be acquired by Google.

Tencent Holdings, a Chinese multinational tech conglomerate and the world’s largest games publisher, made six acquisitions in the  videogaming space. Tencent also expressed that it will invest $70bn in cloud computing, AI and cybersecurity over the next five years.

Salesforce, which has been one of tech’s biggest acquirers in recent years, was active in the cloud space. Its largest deal of 2020 was the acquisition of Slack Technologies for $27.7bn. The deal is the largest in the cloud software-as-a-service industry, even eclipsing Microsoft’s $26.2bn splurge on LinkedIn in 2016. Salesforce also made acquisitions in Commerce experiences space (Mobify), CDP (Evergage), media & publication (The CMO Club), and in June 2020 it acquired Vlocity, cloud and mobile software provider built natively on Salesforce platform, for $1.38bn. 

This year, we saw that once niche products and applications have become more popular and seen surging demand, leading to inflated stock prices on the public market and increased investment from venture firms on the private side.

For years, Google parent Alphabet was on a deal-making spree to grow through billions of dollars in startup acquisitions and investments through its VC arms. This year, with government antitrust regulators bearing down, the company's buying spree has slowed, with just five acquisitions completed in the areas of data, mobile app development and commerce. The recent government lawsuit claims that Google uses anticompetitive behaviour to preserve a monopoly for its search engine and suffocate the competition from smaller rivals. 

Facebook is facing similar significant challenges to Alphabet, as the government is preparing antitrust suits against the company. Moreover, it is facing additional allegations over deals for Instagram and Whatsapp, that brought top social media companies globally under Facebook’s control. Amongst Facebook’s acquisitions were Giphy, a hugely popular moving-image app and Kustomer, an e-commerce app.

Some other notable deals of 2020 by tech acquirers were SAP’s acquisition of Emarsys, an omnichannel customer engagement leader; Wix.com’s acquisition of Websplanet, broadening Wix’s SMB offering; and Nielsen’s acquisition of Precima, an industry leading, SaaS-based provider of powerful retail and customer data applications and analytics.

# Mid-market buyers

Data, platforms, digital experiences, advanced analytics, and speed are now the global foundations for modern marketing. This has driven advertisers to rethink their operating models, approach to tech, and role within the marketing value chain. In turn, they have turned to a new breed of marketing services firms that go beyond traditional media approaches to offer deep expertise on technology best practices, in-house team design and technical implementation, advanced measurement, and privacy. This trend only accelerated as COVID-19 made brands even more reliant on e-commerce and data-driven marketing. The companies that were in a position to ride this wave have grown in 2020 while less technologically advanced groups declined.

Hakuhodo was the most active acquirer among the mid-market buyers category, with five majority and one minority acquisition completed in 2020. Its first acquisition in 2020 was its first M&A deal in India – Adglobal360, the fastest growing MarTech Company (ranked by Deloitte, 2019) The acquisition was quickly followed by another one in APAC – Growww Media Co, a Taiwanese agency group

Hakuhodo’s, kyu collective was responsible for the rest of the acquisitions, including a US communications firm Gofrey Dadich Partners; and later kyu’s Canadian subsidiary Sid Lee acquired the LA-based social media agency Denizen. In December 2020, kyu’s Kepler acquired Infectious Media, a leading digital media specialist with offices in London and Singapore. Together, the group will have nearly 400 people globally. Hakuhodo also acquired a minority 25% stake in another UK-based company - a digital transformation consultancy Public Digital, with the option to increase to a majority interest in the future.

S4 also completed five acquisitions in 2020. In the first half of the year, S4 acquired a Mexico-based digital marketing agency Circus Marketing and the Argentina-based Digodat, a data & analytics consultant (bolt-on to MightyHive).  In July, S4 raised an additional $100m to explore larger deals. Its following acquisitions were “bolt-on”s to its existing portfolio companies – MightyHive and Mediamonks. These included a 25-people Lens10 Pty, Australian digital strategy and analytics consultancy; Orca Pacific, a 40-people US-based Amazon specialist agency, and BrightBlue Consulting, a 25-people UK-based provider of data analytics and measurement consultancy services. All three of the above were merged with MightyHive. S4’s latest acquisition – a 80-people France-based digital creative agency Dare.Win, will be merged with Mediamonks, expanding its presence in France, Europe’s third largest advertising market.

All of Bauer Media’s acquisitions were in the media and publishing space, across Australia, Germany and the UK.

The Stagwell Group, a digital marketing and investment firm, made three acquisitions via its subsidiary firm. ForwardsPMX, Stagwell’s performance marketing agency, acquired Headliner Labsm a start-up that creates ecommerce tools; and SKDKnickerbocker, Stagwell’s public affairs and consulting firm, acquired Sloane & Company and Seward Square (both companies specializing in politics-related public affairs).

Carlyle Group-backed Dept continued building its digital capabilities with the acquisition of Hinderling Volkart, a leading Swiss digital agency (60 people), Sorthvid, a Copenhagen-based strategic digital design agency (100 people), and most recently the company’s first acquisition in the US – a San Diego-based branding and digital design agency BASIC (120 people).

Next15 also finished the year with three acquisitions - Nectar Communications, Craft Consulting and Future Thinking Group (via its data & insights group Savanta).

Brandtech firm You & Mr Jones, which aims to give companies the tools to bring marketing work in-house, raised a $200 million funding round in late 2019, giving it a valuation of $1.3 billion. Its revenues rose 27 percent in organic terms in the first half of 2020 as COVID-19 increased the need for brands to accelerate their digital transformation. In August, it acquired Collectively, a US-based influencer marketing company, that it will combine with Amplify, with an aim of building “the world’s number-one genuinely global influencer capability”. You & Mr Jones also continued to focus on AI technology by announcing $4m investment in AI Foundation and in a IoT company Evrythng.

Throughout the last financial year, ending on 30 June 2020, the Serviceplan Group, Europe’s largest independent agency group, has maintained market stability despite the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and its impact. At €448 million, global agency fees saw an increase on those of the previous year. In July, Serviceplan acquired one of the Netherlands’ leading media and digital marketing agencies – Mediaxplain, that is now the foundation of the Netherlands House of Communications. Later in the year, Serviceplan acquired a shareholding in the San Francisco- and New York-based Pereira O’Dell, a highly regarded digital creative agency, bolstering significantly the group’s creative capability in its US House of Communications.
