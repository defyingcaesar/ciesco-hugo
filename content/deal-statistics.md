# Deal statistics

###### 2020 saw a significant decline in the deal volume for M&A in the technology, digital, media, and marketing sectors. With 1,091 transactions recorded in 2020, the sector experienced a 19% drop over 2019 levels, well below the average 1,241 deals per annum recorded over the last 5 years’ period. This has largely been driven by the COVID-19 impact on buyer confidence, valuations and financing issues, compounded by the need to adjust to the “new normal” and significant changes in consumer behaviour

Despite the business uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis, 2020 was a more eventful year for the M&A activity than may have been expected. Deal activity remained global throughout the year – with buyers acquiring targets from 83 different countries.

The total value of deals with disclosed values recorded in 2020 stood at $83.7bn, approximately 40% lower than the value recorded in the previous year. $27.7bn, or almost 57% of this total number, represents the value of the Salesforce acquisition of Slack, in a multi-billion-dollar mega-deal (defined as deals over $10bn).
Excluding this mega-deal, the total disclosed deal value in 2020 was $55.9bn, a staggering 50% decline on 2019 levels. It should be noted that the true total value of deals will be significantly higher than the figure quoted above, as majority of the M&A transaction values do not get disclosed.
2020 also saw a decrease in the number of large transactions (defined as deals with a value of at least $1bn). This number dropped to only 13 deals from 28 deals in 2019. One notable deal in this category was the acquisition of ticketing software StubHub by Viagogo, for $4.1bn. The company, which was previously owned by eBay, will complement Viagogo’s marketplace reaching fans in 70 countries.

In terms of the deal volume, the year started off strongly - a total of 345 M&A transactions were recorded in Q1 2020 versus 263 in Q1 2019, representing a 31% increase in the M&A activity compared to the same period in 2019. This was mainly as a result of solid macroeconomic conditions, high equity prices and buoyant financing conditions, prior to the pandemic turmoil. However, the second half of Q1 2020 saw increasing concerns over the impact of the pandemic on business models and future earnings heightened. Without reliable financial projections, it is very hard to price a deal, doubts over valuations grew and corporates mainly focused on cash preservation. Some acquisitions and divestitures still completed, mostly between companies within the same sector and facing similar economic impacts. In some instances, the deals process was even accelerated to get ahead of further pandemic fallout.
The impact of COVID-19 became evident in Q2 2020, when we saw significant drops in deal volume in April and May (43% and 45% respectively, compared to the same period in the previous year). Some planned deals were either put on hold or cancelled outright, others were turned into long-term collaborations or supply arrangements.

During Q3 and Q4 2020, the market managed to slightly bounce back, but deal volumes remained significantly lower than the ones recorded in 2019. As the year came to an end, we saw a positive shift in economic sentiment on the market and expect that the companies that have showed resilience and performed well over the last several months will continue to grow and become more valuable.

###### Only 13 acquisitions above the $1bn threshold were announced in 2020, a significant decrease from the 28 announced in the previous year.

There was one mega deal (deals with values over $10bn) announced in the focus sector in 2020 - Salesforce, the number one provider of CRM software solutions and enterprise cloud computing globally, acquired Slack, in a $27.7bn deal which enhances Salesforce enterprise software offering, at a time when digitalization and the ability to work remotely is key. This transaction will create strong synergies for both organisations increasing agility and reducing complexity.
