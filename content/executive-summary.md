## Deal statistics

2020 saw a significant decline in the deal volume for mergers and acquisitions in the technology, digital, media and marketing sectors. With 1,091 transactions recorded in 2020, the sector experienced a 19% drop over 2019 levels, well below the average 1,241 deals per annum recorded over the last 5-years’ period. This has largely been driven by the COVID-19 impact on buyer confidence, valuations and financing issues, compounded by the need to adjust to the “new normal” and significant changes in consumer behaviour. The total value of deals, excluding mega-deals (defined as deals over $10bn), was $55.9bn, a staggering 50% decline on 2019 levels.

## Notable deals

This year saw the completion of a number of notable deals in the sector, in particular the acquisition of Slack by Salesforce, the number one provider of CRM software solutions in a $27.7bn deal which enhances Salesforce enterprise software offering.

Only 13 acquisitions above the $1bn threshold were announced in 2020, a significant decrease from the 28 announced in the previous year. These included several transactions in the e-gaming space, such as the acquisition of The Stars Group by Flutter, the company behind the well-known video gaming providers PaddyPower, Betfair, Sportsbet, TGV and FanDuel, the acquisition of Turkey-based game developer Peak by the San Francisco-based social games pioneer Zynga, and Microsoft’s acquisition of ZeniMax Media with its game publishing arm Bethesda Softworks for $7.5bn in cash.

## Buyer landscape

### Holding networks

After sluggish activity in 2019 it was expected that the global holding networks would pick up the pace in 2020. However, given the events of the year and the networks’ focus on restructuring, and consolidation, the six largest holding companies showed a further decline in deal volume, completing only 15 deals in 2020, down 42% from 2019’s total of 26, and a 71% reduction on the 52 deals recorded in 2018. This decline is even more dramatic against the networks’ halcyon days of 2016 when a totsl o95 deals were completed by the Big Six.

Dentsu was once again the most acquisitive among the holding networks, a mantle they have held for the past three years, and the only holding network in the top 10 active buyers list, with six transactions conducted via three of its operating companies – Merkle, Voyange Group and Cmer TV.

WPP completed four acquisitions (vs only one in the year prior). IPG acquired two companies, whereas Publicis, Havas and Omnicom announced one transaction each.

### Consultancies

Consultancies suffered a 30% decline, following years of strong activity in the market. The market frictions caused by national lockdowns, resulted in major client projects being postponed. Nevertheless, Accenture was again at the forefront of this activity, making 12 acquisitions in 2020. Capgemini and EY also showed some M&A activity, with four completed transactions combined between them.

### Technology

Technology firms continued their M&A activity in the sector, with a stronger focus on digital media, video gaming, cloud-based solutions and ecommerce. The category’s most active buyer was Cognizant, followed by Twitter (including acquisitions made via ShareChat)  and Tencent. There was some activity by GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple) as well, however at a smaller rate than other players and than in previous years - a result of Covid-19 but also ongoing regulatory hearings into allegedly anti-competitive market behaviour of these companies.

### Mid-market

Mid-market groups remained active acquirers in the sector. Hakuhodo, the 11th largest agency group worldwide, after several years of acquisition slumber, made five acquisitions which placed the company in the 2020 Top 10 Most active buyers list. Sir Martin Sorrell’s S4 Capital also completed five transactions in the sector and prepared the market for its upcoming more aggressive M&A activity, now that there is greater certainty around Brexit.

### Emerging buyers

There were new active buyers in the sector, ranging from established tech companies to new bespoke funds. Intracto, a 1,300-people company, made seven acquisitions that, combined, added 670 people to the group. Other notable buyers in this category include Berlin-based Social Chain, France-based Fimalac and California-based W2O.

### Private equity

In light of a significant overall reduction in global deal volumes compared to 2019, it is not surprising that the number of private equity deals in this universe declined by 29%, However, private equity investors collectively proved resilient in these sectors, representing 38% of all buyers in 2020.

Waterland emerged as the most active PE buyer, with 8 deals completed in 2020 (majority done via Intracto).

## Geographic overview
