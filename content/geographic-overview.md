###### The US and the UK were once again the most active M&A markets in 2020, with 505 and 143 deals respectively, followed by France, Germany, Canada and Netherlands. All these countries combined represent 76% of the global deal flow.

After a volatile 2019, which saw the US-China trade war, uncertainty concerning UK elections and Brexit deal negotiations, 2020 started on a high note with stock indices reaching their all-time highs, economic growth on a track of 3.3%, and higher global asset prices as a result of loose monetary policies. Deal activity followed with an increase of 31%  in the first quarter. Soon after, the entire world would face the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented geopolitical threat, which halted the M&A activity worldwide, caused stock markets to suffer their lowest drops in history and oil prices to crash, becoming negative for the first time in history.

##### USA

USA recorded the highest number of transactions, with 46% of the worldwide transactions involving a US-based target, despite a 19% decline in transaction volume from 2019.  Also, USA-based acquisitions consisted of 70% of the global deal value in 2020. 81% of the transactions involved a domestic bidder, similar to 2019.

One of the highlight deals in the USA was ViacomCBS’ $2.1bn sale of its Simon & Schuster subsidiary to the German media group Bertelsmann through its Penguin Random House division. Partnering with the third largest publisher in the USA, home to Dan Brown, Hillary Clinton and Stephen King, was another step towards Bertelsmann’s consolidation plans

##### UK

UK saw a 36% year-on-year drop in its deal activity, recording 81 less deals than the previous year. The uncertainty triggered by the pandemic, and the scepticism around the hard Brexit possibility, resulted in corporate development plans being put off - our data shows a 11.5% decline in the number of cross-border deals from 2019.

Huntsworth, a 1500+ people leading PR & Communications firm for the pharmaceutical and biotech companies, was recently acquired by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), through a $737m LBO. CD&R will benefit from Huntworth’s attractive markets, which indicate long-term growth potential. Likewise, the health advisory firm Cello Health was sold to Arsenal Capital Partners, a PE house focused on healthcare investments for $238m. The acquisition will complement the capabilities of their portfolio company Pharma Value Demonstration.
