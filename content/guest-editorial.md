While COVID-19 has created new challenges to overcome in every sector, on the whole, technology has remained resilient throughout, with new opportunities emerging.

The pandemic has demonstrated that we are more reliant on technology and digital services than ever. Technology has become synonymous with agile working, and new tools designed to boost productivity, collaboration and engagement are now key investment priorities for many.

Companies across the sector have a big opportunity to tap into this rapidly increasing demand for digitisation and tech solutions as we move into 2021 – and the support of a dedicated private equity partner can be key to maximising growth and success.

###### Growing in partnership

LDC has a strong track record of partnering with technology firms to drive growth. Across the UK, we have supported more than 130 technology and digital businesses with over £1billion of capital and we have invested £550million in the sector in the last five years alone.

A recent example is Beekman Associates. In September 2020, we invested more than £17million to help the team enhance its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering and expand overseas, championing its industry-leading software platform RightSpend.

And in July 2020, we supported the merger of DoubleEdge Professional Services, Foehn and Metaphor IT to form Kerv, a next-generation managed cloud services provider. Using our £30million funding package, the team is now embarking on an ambitious buy-and-build strategy to grow its reputation for customer service excellence in IT managed services, security, compliance and unified communications.

###### Growing in partnership

But it’s not just about the up-front investment. Our backing can help management teams target international expansion, grow through acquisition, and roll out new products and services – and the successes of our portfolio speak for themselves. 
Take Texthelp, the leading global provider of literacy and numeracy assistive technologies. Over an 18-month partnership, we helped Texthelp expand its footprint across North America, shift its marketing strategy from nearly 100% events focused to 100% digital, revamp its pricing and discounting strategies and launch its new cloud-based writing assessment tool WriQ, all whilst growing revenues by 40 per cent.  This led to a highly successful onward sale transaction for all parties to a secondary PE Buyer, Five Arrows Principal Investments in December 2020, where Texthelp plans to continue its global expansion as well as its new product development pipeline.

We also completed a partial exit of Babble, the communications and cyber security specialist, in November 2020. The deal valued the company at £90million, and followed a three-year partnership that saw Babble make a total of six acquisitions, helping it to grow revenues by 230%.

While 2021 is set to be another turbulent year for businesses, it’s clear that with the right support, technology firms have an opportunity to lead the charge when it comes to adapting to the new world created by the pandemic.

With £1.2bn to invest over the next three years, we are committed to backing the UK’s most ambitious management teams, and are actively looking to partner with growing technology companies to help accelerate their growth plans. It will be exciting to see what new digital technology innovation we can look forward to in the year ahead.

## 2021: Driving the transformation of customer experiences to the top of the business agenda

No single 12-month period has brought about more alterations to consumer behaviour and expectations than 2020. It was a year that revealed how few businesses truly knew their individual customers, as well as throwing into sharp relief digital gaps in brands’ ways of working. This has created two high-profile trends for businesses that will transcend this pandemic: one will manifest as a drive in D2C focus for most brands to get closer to their customers, and the second is the development of adaptive behaviours, a.k.a. transformation – how the business works and responds to change.

Shifting the business narrative to doing the right things for customers to meet individual needs requires the linking of experiences across marketing, commerce, sales, service and any part of the business that touches the consumer. Delivering this customer experience transformation should be framed through the realisation of hyper-personalised moments; deploying data, technology, and analytics to inform each interaction, through every channel. To accomplish this, businesses must have a plan for how to grow, administer, and deliver a customer-centric approach.

Secondly, digital transformation will be a trend that sees a real resurgence after its initial peak a few years back. It is essential to understand the ways your company must think, plan, and deliver unique personal conversations. The best brands will excel through their design and implementation of customer-centric digital marketing, commerce, and service experiences - experiences that are contextually relevant and personally informed.

Thirdly, organisations will succeed in 2021 through their ability to embody adaptability in how they are operating. Marketing, sales, commerce, and service should no longer be working separately but in unison, fostering a culture of innovation, agility, and shared goals.

One final trend to consider is the increased focus on social good for all businesses. The events of last summer’s BLM protests shone an intense light on our duty to fairly represent the populations we are employing and serving as brands. Additionally, as the beneficial impact of reduced human activity on the environment during the lockdown months became clear, the much-discussed role of sustainability has rapidly shifted from that of a supporting narrative in the business story to become a fundamental driver of customer engagement and loyalty. This is no longer limited to a narrow set of demographics; through the pandemic a push for sustainability is now represented across a far wider community of customers. For example, Google Trends data shows that through the coronavirus crisis in the ‘food’ category people were increasingly searching for ‘sustainable’, ‘local food’, and ‘veganism’. According to a 2020 Global Euromonitor report, 53% of people now feel that they can make an impact on the globe with their purchases, while 47% consciously try to make a positive difference to their environment through everyday actions. Both equity of representation and sustainability are driving cultural change and impacting how consumers perceive and engage with brands. It’s incumbent on us to respond authentically to these growing concerns – they matter to our customers, our colleagues, humanity and our planet alike.

2020 may have been a year of immense change, but 2021 represents a year of great opportunities in consequence – and the best brands will hone a laser focus on customer experiences and priorities to seize these.

## From 2020 to 2021 – a move towards the Business of Experience

It is difficult to overstate quite how transformative 2020 was. In a matter of weeks, almost everything that we do – how people buy, how they work, how they interact with others – was turned on its head.

In many respects, 2020 only accelerated trends that were developing long before the onset of Covid-19; businesses have always looked for new ways to remain relevant, build followings, and matter to people

But the pandemic amplified demand for new approaches. Our research found that 77% of CEOs now believe they will have to fundamentally rethink how they interact and engage with their customers.

Far from being temporary, we expect this appetite will only increase as we move into 2021 and firms move away from thinking in terms of Customer Experience and embrace a mindset we’ve identified as the Business of Experience.


Brands are fundamentally built through experience. Today, it’s less about interrupting people’s lives with paid-for media and more about being relevant within their lives with a clear sense of purpose.

The true experience champions don't just focus on incremental improvements to the customer interface; they align all aspects of their business with the customer.

The Business of Experience involves embedding this thinking throughout your business and restructuring it around delivering exceptional experiences for you customers. It’s a new way of working that requires a business to stop thinking of Customer Experience as a workstream for the CMO.

It’s a shift away from making people want things, to making things people want; from focusing on the product the company wants to sell, to focusing on the outcome the customer wants. This shapes everything from how you talk to your customers and staff, to the platforms they experience and the products they use.

And it’s an approach that is helping businesses pivot back to growth. Our research found that firms built around a Business-of-Experience mindset outperform their peers six times in year-on-year profitability.

In the months ahead, companies across all industries will be looking to find new ways to grow. We believe the Business of Experience is going to be an incredible engine for meaningful disruption, market differentiation and customer satisfaction.

## A view from America

In 2020, it wasn’t pretty. Stuffing a decade’s worth of
crisis and events into 12 insane months is difficult to
comprehend and almost impossible imagine. As
unbelievable as it was, 2020 did happen, and the
America that started the year is a much different
country as we start 2021.

As the CEO of Pereira O’Dell (a U.S. based digital
creative agency), I started 2020 with high hopes for
our company and country.
The economy was booming and our business was strong and growing.
Optimizing quickly turned in concern and then
outright fear as the pandemic reach our shores. On
March 13th we left our offices in NYC and San
Francisco (they remain empty) and marched into the
unknown. Our first priority was to protect health and
well-being of our staff and stabilize the business. Our
leadership team immediately developed an operating
plan with a one primary goal, protect as many jobs as
possible. We were very transparent with our staff and
asked everyone to commit to this common goal.
Fortunately, we also have a great client partners who
stuck with us during the most difficult of times.
Adversity and the shared experience has created
deeper client relationships and because of them we
were able to keep all our staff. We will be forever
grateful.

The pandemic forced us to adapt to remote work, but
the murder of George Floyd on May 25th cut far
deeper into the soul of the country and our company.
The pervasive emotions were outrage and sadness
and as a team we had many honest yet difficult
conversations around race and diversity. It was time
to listen and learn and we quickly made the decision
to engage a DEI consultant to guide us over the next
2 years. Based on the feedback from our team, it’s
the best decision we’ve ever made.

Despite the chaos and challenges, 2020 was a good
for our company. I believe we became stronger and
more resilient as a team. We also managed to
complete a minority investment with our new
partners, The Serviceplan Group. Thanks Ciesco!

As for 2021...after the events of January 6th we are
hurting and divided as a nation, but I’m hopeful
brighter days are ahead of us all.
