# Deal statistics

##### 2020 saw a significant decline in the deal volume for M&A in the technology, digital, media, and marketing sectors. With 1,091 transactions recorded in 2020, the sector experienced a 19% drop over 2019 levels, well below the average 1,241 deals per annum recorded over the last 5 years’ period. This has largely been driven by the COVID-19 impact on buyer confidence, valuations and financing issues, compounded by the need to adjust to the “new normal” and significant changes in consumer behaviour.

Despite the business uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis, 2020 was a more eventful year for the M&A activity than may have been expected. Deal activity remained global throughout the year – with buyers acquiring targets from 83 different countries.

The total value of deals with disclosed values recorded in 2020 stood at $83.7bn, approximately 40% lower than the value recorded in the previous year. $27.7bn, or almost 57% of this total number, represents the value of the Salesforce acquisition of Slack, in a multi-billion-dollar mega-deal (defined as deals over $10bn). 
Excluding this mega-deal, the total disclosed deal value in 2020 was $55.9bn, a staggering 50% decline on 2019 levels. It should be noted that the true total value of deals will be significantly higher than the figure quoted above, as majority of the M&A transaction values do not get disclosed.
2020 also saw a decrease in the number of large transactions (defined as deals with a value of at least $1bn). This number dropped to only 13 deals from 28 deals in 2019. One notable deal in this category was the acquisition of ticketing software StubHub by Viagogo, for $4.1bn. The company, which was previously owned by eBay, will complement Viagogo’s marketplace reaching fans in 70 countries.
