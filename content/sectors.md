CRM is the only sector which saw an annual increase, 30% from 2019. The largest software market globally, which is expected to reach $80bn revenue by 2025, can be accessed from any device, including mobile phones as of 2020. The trend of ‘remote working’ demanded more than ever flexible mobile and cloud solutions to deliver personalized experience for their customers.

On the other hand, Strategy suffered the steepest decline. Only 32 deals were announced, 57% less than in 2019. Consultancies have taken a hit globally as a result of delays or cancellations in clients projects.

### Digital Media

Digital Media remains the most active sector in 2020, with a total of 206 deals completed, 2 more deals than in 2019. The long-discussed trend of introducing digital capabilities into agencies’ business models, was accelerated further when market frictions demanded a high differentiation among the competition.

Housebound consumers worldwide started to shift their daily habits - outside dining was replaced with delivery apps, in person business meetings were substituted with virtual conferences, whereas traditional shopping with ecommerce platforms. The closing of main entertainment hubs such as the theatres and cinemas resulted in a surge of online streaming.

One of the key transactions involving a streaming service was Fox Corporation’s acquisition of the US-based free streaming service Tubi TV for $440m. With 25 million monthly viewers, Tubi will provide Fox’s advertising partners with the opportunity to reach larger audiences.

44% of the digital media targets acquired, focus on online gaming. The multi billion-dollar subsector has become one of the most profitable in the world, challenging more traditional entertainment activities. This breakthrough can be explained with the recent increase in popularity of subscription models, In-app purchases, rewards and loyalty systems.
