<p>I am pleased to present Ciesco’s Annual Global M&amp;A
Review, the 2020 edition. Our Review details the M&amp;A
deal activity throughout 2020 that has shaped the
technology, digital, media and marketing sectors.
As dealmakers, we are accustomed to facing
uncertainty, but the scale and speed of COVID-19
sent shockwaves through the global economy and
the M&amp;A market. The first half of 2020 started with
unprecedented highs and ended with extraordinary
lows. In the second half of the year, we saw signs of
improvement and the rebound of deal making activity
in the technology, digital, media and marketing
sectors.</p>
<p>Ciesco tracked 1,091 transactions in 2020, the sector
experienced a 19% drop over 2019 levels, on par
with average global decline in general M&amp;A activity
driven by COVID-19. The total value of deals,
excluding mega-deals (defined as deals over $10bn),
was $55.9bn, a staggering 50% decline on 2019
levels.</p>
<p>Digital and tech-enabled companies saw strongest
buyer appetite. Our data showed that Digital,
Traditional Media and MarTech companies remained
the most active sectors and represented 51% of all
M&amp;A activity in the sector in 2020. Unsurprisingly, we
saw deal activity decrease across all sectors, except
one – CRM, which saw a 30% increase in the number
of deals completed in this sector.</p>
<p>The buyer landscape in 2020 showed a flatter and
more diverse picture. Only a few years ago, the top
active buyers would each have acquired over 20
companies throughout a year and the list would have
mainly featured holding networks and consulting
giants. In 2020, Accenture, a leading global
consulting firm, remained the top buyer with 12 deals
completed – versus their record-breaking 16 deals in
the space the previous year. It is followed by
Waterland Private Equity - a Dutch-based PE firm,
whose portfolio company Intracto has shown strong
deal appetite in 2020. Sharing third and fourth place
on the list are Twitter and Cognizant, two global tech
firms. The rest of the list features more PE firms, mid-
market groups and only one holding network –
Dentsu, with 6 acquisitions in 2020 (a 54% decline on
2019).</p>
<p>Whether you are a potential investor, a strategic
buyer or a stakeholder planning the future for your
business, we hope you find the information in this
review report insightful and informative. All reported
data on deal activity is overlaid with our perspectives
and insights, reflecting our substantial knowledge
and understanding of the overall industry. Ciesco
Outlook, in particular, reflects our deep roots,
experience and expectations of being practitioners in
the sector and having managed and strategically led
companies throughout the various disciplines and
geographies.</p>
<p>This year you will note a new, improved format of our
report. We are also pleased to include four guest
editorials various industry leaders across different
target and buyer sectors and categories.</p>
