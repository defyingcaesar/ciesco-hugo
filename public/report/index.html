    <h2 id="deal-statistics">Deal statistics</h2>
<p>With a tostal of 1,345 transactions, the overall deal
volume in 2019 fell slightly when compared to
previous year, a 3.4% decline from the record high of
2018 when 1,392 deals were recorded. Similarly, the
total value of deals with disclosed values reached
$140.4bn, a much lower value than the record high of
$304bn seen in 2018. If the total value is adjusted to
exclude any mega-deals (deals with values over
$10bn), then the total value of deals with disclosed
values in 2019 stood at $112.4bn, surpassing the
previously record high of $85.6bn reached in 2018, or
a 31.4% increase over the 2018 levels.</p>
<h2 id="notable-deals">Notable deals</h2>
<p>This year saw the completion of a number of notable
deals in the sector, in particular CBS merging with
Viacom in a $12bn transaction, whilst KKR acquired
Axel Springer in a deal valuing the company at
$7.6bn.
We also witnessed the $15.7bn acquisition by
Salesforce, the No 1 CRM leader, of Tableau Software,
the No 1 data analytics platform, whilst Publicis
acquired Epsilon, the data-driven marketing solutions
provider, in a $4.4bn deal. Furthermore, private
equity powerhouse Bain Capital acquired Kantar, the
UK-based global data, research, consulting and
analytics firm in a deal valuing the company at $4bn.</p>
<h2 id="buyer-landscape">Buyer landscape</h2>
<h3 id="holding-networks">Holding networks</h3>
<p>The global marketing holding networks were again
subject to a year of turbulent share prices and poor
financial performance, both of which had an impact
on their M&amp;A appetite. The six largest holding
companies showed a further decline in deal volume,
completing only 26 deals in 2019, down 50% from
2018’s total of 52, and a 62% reduction on the 69
deals recorded in 2017. The decline in deal volume
from the six largest holding companies, compounded
by an increase in deal activity driven by players from
the consultancy, tech and private equity world, meant
the percentage of total deals completed by holding
networks is now only 2%, down from 4% in 2018 and
11% in 2014. Only Dentsu, Havas, and Publicis
counted as most active holding network buyers by
deal volume, with Havas managing to increase its
deal count to 6 deals, two more than in previous year.
Both Dentsu and Publicis experienced relative
declines in their deal volume year-on-year, with 13
and 5 transactions respectively (compared to 19 and
7 deals in the previous year). IPG was the only
network of the Big Six to see no M&amp;A activity at all in
2019, whilst WPP and Omnicom recorded only one
transaction each.</p>
<h3 id="consultancies">Consultancies</h3>
<p>Consultancies suffered a 30% decline, following years
of strong presence in the market. The market frictions
caused by national lockdowns, resulted in major client
projects being postponed or put on hold.
Nevertheless, Accenture was again at the forefront of
this activity, making 12 acquisitions in 2020, a slight
decline from their 16 deal count recorded in 2019.</p>

</div>

<div class="col">
    <h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>Technology firms continued their M&amp;A activity in the
sector, with a particular push towards data &amp;
analytics and content &amp; production spaces. In
particular, Salesforce acquisition of Tableau Software
is expected to supercharge their customer’s digital
transformations by enabling them to get rapid
insights and make impactful, data-driven decisions.</p>
<h3 id="mid-market">Mid-market</h3>
<p>Mid-market groups remained active acquirers in the
sector, with Stagwell Group representative of this
category. The US firm, which entered the market in
2017 as a major emerging buyer, continued to add to
its acquisition spree, recording eight deals in 2019.</p>
<h3 id="emerging-buyers">Emerging buyers</h3>
<p>2019 again saw a number of new entrants into the
marketplace, ranging from established tech buyers to
new bespoke funds. Most notably S4 Capital, the
acquisition vehicle established by Sir Martin Sorrell in
2018, has consolidated its position in 2019 by
completing eight acquisitions, four times more than
its 2018 deal count.
Private equity</p>
<p>The accumulation of large pools of capital from
previous years meant that 2019 continued to be
among extraordinary years for private equity firms in
the sector. Deal transactions involving a private
equity buyer accounted for 42% of all deals,
compared to 22% the year before. These deals were
either acquisitions by the PE funds themselves, or via
their existing portfolio companies looking to grow
through M&amp;A.</p>
<p>KKR emerged as the most active PE buyer, with 10
deals completed in 2019 either directly or via portfolio
companies.</p>
<h2 id="geographic-overview">Geographic overview</h2>
<p>The US and UK remained the two largest markets in
terms of deal volume, with targets from these
countries accounting for 50% and 16% respectively,
of overall deal volume. Both UK and North America
experienced growth in deal activity in 2019, whilst
previously strong performing regions, like LatAm,
APAC and Africa, all saw significant declines. In
Western Europe, Spain and Netherlands witnessed the
highest increase in deal volume year-on-year (with
180% and 95% increases respectively). The
proportion of cross-border deals also increased year-
on-year, now representing 38% (compared to 29% in
2018).</p>
<h2 id="sectors">Sectors</h2>
<p>Digital Media and Traditional Media remained the
most popular sectors, with 206 and 165 deals
respectively. Combined these two sectors represented
40% of all deal activity throughout. However, they
experienced declines of 11% and 21% respectively.
CRM was the only sector which saw a year-on-year
increase of 10% from 2019, whereas Strategy
witnessed the largest decline – 61% less transactions
than the previous year.</p>
<p>The MarTech sector, with its 126 deal count, came in third place, recording a 19% decline from 2019 levels. This was followed by Agency Services (99 deals) and Digital Agency (98 deals), both sectors experiencing deal volume declines year-on-year as well.</p>
